A tool that I created to use some of the known methods of disabling tracking in Windows 10.

## Methods Used

#### Telemetry

Set the `AllowTelemetry` string in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection` to `0`

#### DiagTrack Log

Clears and disables writing to the log located in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Diagnosis\ETLLogs\AutoLogger`

#### Services

You can delete or disable the 2 services below:
* `DiagTrack` Diagnostics Tracking Service
* `dmwappushsvc` WAP Push Message Routing Service

Action:
* Delete: Remove both services
* Disable: Set the `Start` registry key for both services to `4` (Disabled) Located at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\`

#### HOSTS

Append known tracking domains to the `HOSTS` file located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`

#### IP Blocking

Blocks known tracking IPs with the Windows Firewall. The rules are named TrackingIPX, replacing X with the IP numbers.

#### Windows Defender

Disables the following:
- Automatic Sample Submission
- Delivery Optimization Download Mode
 
#### WifiSense
Disables the following:
- Credential Share
- Open-ness

#### OneDrive

Runs `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall` (64 bit) or  
`C:\Windows\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall` (32 bit)

Also disables registry entries that keep the OneDrive Icon pinned to your Windows Explorer list:

## Delete Services vs Disable Services?

Selecting "Disable" will simply stop the services from being able to run.
Selecting the "Delete" choice will completely delete the tracking services.
